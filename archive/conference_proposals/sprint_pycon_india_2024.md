# Title : NetworkX and nx-parallel sprint

# Description

NetworkX and nx-parallel are pure python libraries. Please go through the [contributor's guide of nx-parallel](https://github.com/networkx/nx-parallel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [contributor's guide of NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html). These contributor's guide would help you to setup the project(s). And after setting up the project, just start by looking at the areas of the project that interests you the most and then try to improve them(their docs or tests or fix a bug!, try finding open issues, stale PRs or discussions related to the topics you like). Or you can try to fix the issues with the ["good-first-issues"](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) label in the repository.

Also being a user of the project you want to contribute helps in making good contributions. So if you are not very familiar with network science or graph theory things then you can start with those first. There are nice written tutorials on the NetworkX's website and in nx-guides. There are also some nice video tutorials by Mridul Seth and Eric Ma on youtube from various conferences. I learnt NetworkX mostly from a social networks NPTEL course by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar in which they extensively used NetworkX in the tutorials. But everyone has a different learning style, so, if it doesn't suit yours feel free to look around and find something that fits you and feel free to put any helpful resources in the comments below :) And please feel free to ask any questions below :)

Some more "good-first" things to contribute to:

- adding [embarrassingly parallel](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallel.html) algorithms to the nx-parallel repository
- improving docs, exception handling and test coverage in both networkx and nx-parallel repositories
- Reading the [networkx's backend and configs docs](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/reference/backends.html) and create issues/PRs with specific and constructive feedback to improve them and make them more user-friendly and inclusive
- more to come....

Thank you :) Hope this helps :)
and hope to see you at the sprints!
Aditi

# Speaker Info:

Hi, I'm Aditi. I am currently part of NetworkX's Core Developer team. NetworkX is a Python library with lots of graph algorithms. I've worked on the NetworkX project and the nx-parallel backend, previously as an Independent contractor and a GSoC contributor and a Core Developer. Also, I've presented my work and the NetworkX's dispatching as a poster at SciPy Con this year and as a talk at EuroSciPy 2024. And, I am currently pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science and a bachelor's in Data Science and Application. (Email: aditijuneja7@gmail.com)
