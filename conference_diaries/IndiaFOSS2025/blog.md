## Day 2

- first half of the day spent on managing the FOSS in Science devroom and second half went into visiting booths and talking to people
- FOSS in Science devroom
    - CAD and GIS talk-- really nice talk with lots of interesting demos :)
    - Zarr 
        - interoperability, extensibility and high latency storage
        - office hours
        - zarr - V3 spec-- sharding and extensibility - https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v3/core/index.html
        - store-- ABC store
    - feedback on dispatching talk: have less text and slides; illustrations over text; instead of putting all text on slides-- write less text and explain slides by speaking-- because people try to read the text -- and less attention is to what's being spoken.
    - https://core-stack.org/use-apis/
    - https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html
    - codec entry point -?
- met Anand
    - flashbacks from Anand's string art booth at RootConf 2025

    - he showed his flexing cube-- he let me and Ishaan play with it for a while :)

        </p>
    
    - It was similar to the cube below, but when we folded it, the faces turned out to be triangular rather than parallelogram- or rhombus-shaped, as in the following cube flexing thing (also Anand's flexing cube had a peacock feather pattern on one side and some orange pattern on the second and some blue galaxy-like pattern on the third!)

        </p>

    - and then i showed him my cube puzzle after the conference (this array of small cubes(connected by a red elastic string, going through each small cube) needs to be put together so that they form a 3*3 cube)
