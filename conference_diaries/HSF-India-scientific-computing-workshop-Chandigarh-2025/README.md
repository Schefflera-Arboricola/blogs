I really enjoyed this workshop -- it was such a nice and refreshing experience -- I got to do physics after a long time! Unlike many tutorials or workshops at big conferences, this set of workshops was actually engaging, cohesive, and well-coordinated. All the speakers were amazing — helpful, approachable, and genuinely dedicated. They volunteered to answer questions, made sure no one was left behind, and kept everyone on track and in sync throughout. Both the organizers and speakers valued learning above everything else — even over time or schedule constraints-- which, unfortunately, is quite rare to see! I got to learn a lot, met great, friendly and like-minded people, and had some really inspiring conversations along the way. Heartfelt thanks to all the organizers and speakers for putting this together and letting me be part of this-- (and thanks to Henry for telling me about this workshop) — it was a great and memorable learning experience :)

Thanks for stopping-by :)
